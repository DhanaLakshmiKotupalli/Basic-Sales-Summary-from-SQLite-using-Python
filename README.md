# Basic Sales Summary Using SQLite and Python

This project demonstrates how to use **SQLite** with **Python** to perform basic sales data analysis and visualize the results using **pandas** and **matplotlib**. It is designed for beginners and runs perfectly in **Google Colab** or any local Python environment.

## üîß Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (built-in `sqlite3`)
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- Google Colab

## üìä Task Overview

> The goal is to generate a **basic sales summary** from a small SQLite database.

### Objectives:

- Create and connect to a SQLite database (`sales_data.db`)
- Build a simple `sales` table with product, quantity, and price
- Run SQL queries to calculate:
  - Total quantity sold per product
  - Total revenue per product
- Display results using:
  - `print()` statements
  - A bar chart of total revenue per product
